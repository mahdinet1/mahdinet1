I am a Software Engineer with a strong background software development, and machine learning. With an MSc in Electronic Engineering from the University of Tehran, my work includes innovative projects like non-invasive blood glucose monitoring using PPG signals and real-time systems for object tracking and facial recognition.

I specialize in designing scalable systems, developing hybrid search engines, and creating production-ready solutions with tools like React, Next.js, Python, and TensorRT. Proficient in microservices architecture, CI/CD pipelines, and deployment tools like Docker and Kubernetes, I’m passionate about leveraging technology for impactful, real-world applications.
